                <h1>Curriculum</h1>

                <p>The school studies kata and and researches the corresponding bunkai. Kata are abstract, structured sets of movements which represent a self-defense situation in which the practioner is attacked by multiple adversaries. Bunkai follows from kata, and is the end goal of a serious practioner. Literally meaning analysis or application, bunkai is to find meaning in kata.</p>

                <p>New students will start by practicing kihon (basics). This includes kihon kata and kihon kumite. As a new student progresses, they will add Pinan, Nihanchi, Passai, Kusanku kata to their regimen.</p>

                <p>The physical practice of kata is primarily a solitary affair. Serious students practice their kata alone, every day. Kata practice in the dojo should be supplementary to personal study and not the other way around.</p> 

                <p>Time spent in the dojo is devoted predominately to kumite (grappling hands). Kumite is the physical act of exchanging strikes with one or more partners. Kumite can range from a choreographed sequence of movements to a full-contact, free-form exchange. While practicing, it is never the intent of the practioner to injure their partner. A cooperative and friendly relationship between partners is imperative for productive kumite training.</p>

                <p>Physical conditioning is highly encouraged for all students. Makiwara, endurance, flexibility, and strength training are valuable avenues of practice. Where one specializes and spends their time is up to personal preference and physical capability.</p>
